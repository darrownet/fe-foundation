### Directory Structure
- _configs_ - contains configurations for Jest, PostCss, TypeScript, and Webpack
- _src_ - contains all necessary code for app development (the files in this directory get processed for the build)
- _tests_ - contains test data and test utilities. This directory holds coverage files as well (```__coverage__``` - git ignored)

## Development
### Scripts
+ **npm start:** Starts webpack dev server on localhost port 8080
+ **npm run build:** Creates a new build folder
+ **npm test:** Runs the Jest test runner (currently ~98% coverage)

### Workflow
#### development mode
- Run the command **npm start**
- A browser window should open at http://localhost:8080
- The React application should run
- As you work on the application, changes are propagated to the browser.

#### production mode
- Run the command **npm run build**

----

## Running The Production Application
- Open a terminal and navigate to the build directory.
- Run any web server (ex. _python3 -m http.server_. This will serve the build at http://localhost:8000).
- Open up a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000
